# **Bluestock Fintech - IPO Web Application & REST API**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Bluestock Fintech IPO Web Application & REST API** project! This repository contains the development tasks for building an IPO-related web application and a REST API, designed to serve public and client needs. The project is part of the internship program at Bluestock Fintech, providing practical exposure to full-stack web development.

Our goal is to develop a feature-rich platform that displays detailed IPO-related information and offers users the ability to download essential documents like **RHP** and **DRHP** PDFs. 

This repository contains both the **web application** (UI) and the **REST API** backend components that deliver IPO-related data.

## **Objective**

The main objective of this project is to develop a **web application** and **REST API** to display IPO-related information to the public and integrate it into Bluestock Fintechâ€™s website and our clients' websites. 

Key features of the application include:
- **IPO Information:** Company logo, name, price band, opening/closing dates, issue size, issue type, listing date, status, IPO price, listing price, listing gain, current market price (CMP), and current return.
- **Downloadable PDFs:** Users can download **RHP** (Red Herring Prospectus) and **DRHP** (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) documents.
- **Real-time Data:** Fetch live market data related to IPOs, including current returns and listing prices.
